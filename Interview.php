      <p class="w3-text-grey"></b>Sample answer is</b>
          <br><br>I will answer this question based on some parameters. As far as hard work is concerned, I will rate myself as 8 because there should
          always be a scope to increase our skills which will create an interest in learning the things. When it comes to creativity, I would like to rate
          myself as 9. In the past, I have designed banners and brochures which were appreciated by the clients. To talk about patience, I will tag myself
          with 6 because I am an entry-level professional. Same as personal life, even professional life needs more experience for more patience. That is 
          probably why in most companies senior management looks more patient than entry level or even middle level. Overall, I would rate myself as 8 on a scale of 1 to 10.
